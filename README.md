# Movie-Rental-Database
School Project to create a database

Problem Definition

Our group has decided to make a database project regarding a movie rental system. We decided to make a hypothetical case where an old movie rental company is facing problems with managing data. The management realized that their current method of using spreadsheets was not feasible for maintaining data. This company was looking for an update to provide better support for clients by letting our group build a movie rental database. We wanted to create a simple yet comprehensive client database implementing functions that permits this movie business to operate. Utilizing our system allows clients and employees to instant access to anything from store inventory to movie information. By implementing our system, the movie rental store will have a competitive advantage over other stories and a greater overall productivity rate. This database will also be ideal for any movie rental business to help manage movie, inventory, staff, and customer information needed to provide the fastest and best support for clients.
